## About the Project

The complete project is part of a real web application that is currently in development. As of now, only a limited portion of the codebase is available in this repository. The project's objective is to create a fully functional web application for [trip-memo.com](https://trip-memo.com/).

Please note that due to the ongoing nature of the development, some features and functionalities are not included in this code sample. The purpose of sharing this code is to showcase my proficiency with Python and Django and to provide a glimpse into my development skills.
